                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <!--the first <p> i want it to be placed on the image above-->
                <p>We should strive to build a world that is resilient to climate change and operates with zero carbon
                   emissions, relying solely on renewable energy sources.</p>
                 <p>The climate crisis refers to the urgent and significant changes occurring in Earth's climate
                     patterns due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and 
                     industrial processes. It is characterized by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, leading
                     to global warming and other adverse impacts on the environment and human societies..</p>
              </div>  

              <h4>How the Climate Crises Can Impact our world</h4>
              <p>The climate crisis is primarily driven by the excessive release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other
                 greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, resulting in the warming of 
                 the Earth's surface, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This warming has far-reaching consequences,
                  including rising global temperatures, altered weather patterns, sea-level rise, melting polar ice caps, 
                  increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity.

                The consequences of the climate crisis are already being observed worldwide. Heatwaves, droughts, floods, 
                wildfires, and storms are becoming more frequent and severe, causing significant economic and humanitarian 
                impacts. Coastal areas are at risk of flooding, and low-lying island nations are facing the threat of 
                submersion. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect agricultural productivity, food security,
                 and water resources, leading to potential conflicts and migration.
                
                The climate crisis also exacerbates existing social inequalities, as vulnerable communities, including 
                marginalized populations and developing nations, often bear the brunt of its impacts. Furthermore, it poses 
                a threat to public health, with increased risks of heat-related illnesses, the spread of vector-borne diseases,
                 and reduced air and water quality.
                
                Addressing the climate crisis requires global cooperation and concerted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
                 emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, promote energy efficiency, protect and restore ecosystems,
                 and adapt to the changing climate. International agreements such as the Paris Agreement aim to limit global 
                 warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the
                 temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
                
                Recognizing the severity of the crisis, governments, businesses, organizations, and individuals are taking
                action to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This includes adopting sustainable practices, supporting 
                clean technologies, promoting renewable energy, reducing carbon footprints, and advocating for policy 
                changes.
                
                Addressing the climate crisis is crucial to safeguarding the planet's future, protecting ecosystems and 
                biodiversity, ensuring the well-being of present and future generations, and creating a sustainable and 
                resilient world for all.</p>

                <h4>REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION</h4>

                <p>Forests are natureâ€™s greatest technology for combating climate change: they naturally absorb 
                    carbon dioxide (CO2), reducing the amount of this heat-trapping gas in our atmosphere. 
                    When forests are not managed responsibly, they release large quantities of C02 into the
                     atmosphere. Deforestation and degradation are the largest sources of C02 emissions after 
                     the burning of fossil fuels. Scientists estimate up to 13% of global carbon emissions come 
                     from deforestation.</p>
