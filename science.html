                <h3>Ever Wonder Why Bubbles Are In Some Drinks ?</h3>
                <img src="asset/images/bubble.jpg"  alt="Bubble" style="width: 100%">
                <p> The bubbling and popping phenomenon that occurs when certain drinks are opened is primarily due 
                    to the release of carbon dioxide gas. Carbonation is a process in which carbon dioxide is 
                    dissolved in a liquid under pressure. When the pressure is released, such as when a bottle or 
                    can is opened, the dissolved carbon dioxide is no longer restrained and begins to escape in the
                    form of bubbles.
<br><br>
                    The carbon dioxide gas can be added during the manufacturing process of beverages, such as 
                    carbonated soft drinks, sparkling water, or beer. It can also occur naturally in fermented
                    beverages like champagne or certain types of beer.
                    <br><br>  
                    When the container is opened, the sudden drop in pressure causes the carbon dioxide to rapidly 
                    come out of solution, leading to the formation of bubbles. This process is often accompanied by
                    a popping sound as the gas escapes. The degree of carbonation and the amount of dissolved carbon
                    dioxide in the beverage determine the intensity of bubbling and popping.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, the physical properties of the liquid, such as its viscosity and surface tension, 
                    can also influence the bubbling behavior when opened. These factors can affect how the gas is 
                    released and how the bubbles form and rise to the surface.
                    <br><br>
                    It's worth noting that the presence of other substances or ingredients in the beverage, such as
                    sugars or flavorings, can also affect the release and behavior of carbon dioxide when the drink
                    is opened. However, carbonation remains the primary factor behind the bubbling and popping
                    phenomenon in carbonated beverages.</p>
