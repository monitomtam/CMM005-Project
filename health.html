                <h2>Ever Wonder Why Adults says Sugar is Bad for You ?</h2>
               
                <p>Sugar is a type of carbohydrate that is naturally present in many foods, such as fruits, vegetables,
                     and dairy products. It is also added to numerous processed foods and beverages to enhance their taste.
                     While sugar is a source of energy for the body, excessive consumption, especially of added sugars, 
                     can have negative effects on children's health.
                     Here are some potential side effects of excessive sugar consumption in children:</p>
                    <br><br>
                     <p>Dental Problems: Consuming sugary foods and drinks can contribute to tooth decay and cavities, especially when oral
                     hygiene practices are inadequate.
                     <br><br> </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="sugar">
                     <img class="img_sug" src="asset/images/sugar3.jpg">
                     <div class="text-box">
                    <p>Weight Gain and Obesity: High sugar intake is associated with weight gain and increased risk of obesity in children.
                     Sugary foods and drinks are often high in calories and low in nutritional value, leading to excessive calorie intake
                     without providing necessary nutrients.</p>
                     <br><br>
                    <p>Increased Risk of Chronic Diseases: Overconsumption of sugar has been linked to an increased risk of developing 
                    chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and fatty liver disease later in life.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Poor Nutrition: Foods high in added sugars often lack essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients necessary for
                    proper growth and development. Excessive sugar consumption can displace more nutritious foods from the diet.</p>
                    <br><br>
                   <p> Poor Concentration and Behavior: Some studies suggest that high sugar intake may contribute to hyperactivity and 
                    inattentiveness in children. However, the link between sugar and behavior is still debated, and individual responses
                    can vary. </p>

                    <p>Unhealthy Eating Habits: Regularly consuming sugary foods and drinks can create a preference for sweet tastes and 
                    contribute to an unhealthy eating pattern. This may result in an increased likelihood of consuming processed and
                    unhealthy foods in the long term.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>It's important to note that not all sugars are inherently bad, and naturally occurring sugars in whole foods like 
                    fruits and dairy products come with beneficial nutrients. However, it is crucial to limit added sugars in a child's
                    diet and promote a balanced and varied intake of nutrient-dense foods. </p>
                    <br><br>
                   <p> The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that children aged 2-18 consume no more than 25 grams (6 teaspoons)
                    of added sugars per day. However, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for
                    personalized advice on appropriate sugar intake and overall nutrition for children based on their specific needs 
                    and health status.</p>
